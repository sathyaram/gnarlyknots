      <div class="question">
      How do you warm up the pretzels so I can enjoy them later?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
      Pretzels are just like any other bread product. While heating them up isn’t completely necessary, if you do, we recommend using an oven or toaster oven for reheating. Just for a few minutes until soft again. Please do not microwave! But if you do… just don’t tell us you did. Our stuffed pretzels on the other hand should be reheated in the oven or toaster oven until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees (about 5-8 minutes at 350).

      <div class="question">
      Can I place an order over the phone to be picked up today?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
      Sorry no. We are a first come first serve establishment. If you’d like to place an order ahead of time we require 24 hours advance notice.
      </div>
      <div class="question">
      Why didn't you make more pretzels today?  You always run out!
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
      We make all of our pretzel dough fresh daily.  That means that we access our pretzel needs daily and make as many as history tells us to.  If you know ahead of time that you are going to get a large order (like say a day ahead or at least early morning...) then we can amend our pretzel amounts!!  The dough takes quite a while to rise, roll and bake.... so a late day batch is not an option unfortunately.
      </div>
      <div class="question">
      I got all the way home and saw that my order was incorrect.  WTF??
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
      We are a human run company that can make mistakes from time to time.  It's always a good idea to check your bag before you leave as well - especially if you live far, far away.  Asking us "Is everything in there?" is not the same as checking the bag yourself.  We do our best to ensure the correctness of every order... but sometimes we fail miserably.  Help us to help you!!

      <div class="question">
      Do you have seating?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
      We do not have seating.  We are very close to a great many parks and outdoor areas that will suit your needs!   
      </div>
      <div class="question">
      But why don't you have seating?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
      When we started in the pretzel game, we had no idea that so many folks would love it so much!!  We hoped of course.... but erred on the side of caution when choosing our first location.  We want to make as many pretzels as we possibly can to assuage the masses, that means that our inside space has to be for making!!  So, consider us to be a Take & Go establishment.
